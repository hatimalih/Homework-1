#Assignment Due Date Sept 17.

#Instructions:
- If you are a student who is registered to this class, click on the link that I shared with you. That will create a private Github repository for you. Once you have that repository, clone it to your local by using "git clone".

- Go to src/mypkg then modify the file "my_answers.py". You should be able to run this file as you are editing it but tests will not be run yet.

- In order to run the tests, make sure you have pytest installed in your environment. Simply type "pip install pytest".
      pip is automatically installed if you are:

            working in a virtual environment.

            using Python downloaded from python.org

            using Python that has not been modified by a redistributor to remove ensurepip.
            
      If you having issue running pip please follow instructions using this link
                      https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py


- To build your program, type "python setup.py install".

- In your terminal, cd to Homework-1 and type "pytest". It should run all the tests for this assignment and you should be able to see the output.

- If you are a student registered to this class, you can commit your changes and push your code to your private Github repository. Travis-CI will run the tests you ran in your local in the cloud.
